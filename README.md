Investigating the Relationship Between Social Media Use and Mental Health

Survey data was collected from over 300 participants on 20 variables encompassing demographics, social media use habits, and mental health.

Data cleaning and manipulation were performed in both R and SQL.

Linear and logistic regression models were fit in R. Model fit was assessed to determine reliability of model. Conclusions show some preliminary evidence to support a relationship between increased social media usage and worse mental health, but further study is needed due to several limitations:

1) Uncertain reliability of self-reported survey data
2) Rating scale for mental health conditions is subjective
3) Many factors that go into mental health are unaccounted for in the survey
4) Missing values in dataset

Data visualizations and dashboards were also created in Tableau. (link) 

All in all, further study with more data or a more complex model is needed to reach a firm conclusion.
